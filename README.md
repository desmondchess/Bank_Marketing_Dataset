# Bank_Marketing_Dataset

A bank marketing dataset relating to a Portuguese banking institution's direct marketing campaign (phone calls) was downloaded from UCI machine learning. We intend to use this data to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit or not.

Task - To explore different supervised machine learning algorithms, further explore the support vector machine algorithms and implement an unsupervised algorithm to help make an inference on the best framework to achieve our project goal.
